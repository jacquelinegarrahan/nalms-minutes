# Presentation of requirements to EED

Date: 11/5/2020

## Brief notes:
Mike Zelazny: How to keep the trees in synch with Alarm System and Display Manager?  

William would like operations to build their own alarm trees and not have to rely solely on IOC engineers.  
When can we expext the tool to be available?

Alex: Is there a way to streamline building of the alhConfig files from the IOC Application?  

Shawn Alverson: Please be clear about what user means. Maybe, we should have roles setup.  

Jeremy: Again, clearly define who the user is especially for changing parameters.  

Greg White: What do you mean by plugin? Make the code extensability which means define an API... Examples, sysLog

## Takeaways
