# Design document discussion 4/13/21
Attendees: Mike Zelazny, Greg White, Ernest Williams, Jackie Garrahan  

## Alarm hierarchies
Can engineers have the freedom to put together hierarchies as they like?  
GW: This is fine for a general document, but should be specific details as they pertain to SLAC  
CONCLUSION: Will add an appendix for SLAC specific changes, using the lcls-home drilldown as the basis for hierarchical representations

## Hierarchy construction
Can we create a pydm decorator for linked displays that helps us to capture the hierarchies? Will talk to Matt Gibbs and Hugo...  
TODO: Map out creation of a hierarchy step-by-step  

## MISC
How will upgrades be handled with Phoebus modifications?  
How long are things stored in OCIO stored?  
Will use "help" over "guidance" in tooling
