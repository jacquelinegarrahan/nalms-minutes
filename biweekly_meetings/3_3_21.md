# Biweekly meeting 3/3/2021  


Date: 3/3/21  
Attendees: Ernest Williams, Jackie Garrahan, Mike Zelazny, Jingchen Zhou, Murali Shanker, Matt Gibbs, William Colocho


* Kafka should have own package top (elasticsearch too presumably)  
* Alarm-server/logger inside nalms package  
* Symbolic links used for pieces of configuration that change  
* AFS is fine for the repo, if there is shared code use slaclab  

Gateway  
* Archiver uses gateway heavily  
* Alarm server may not require the gateway, unlikely to have a lot of noise  
* Ernest: Would it be useful to use gateways increasingly  
* PVA gateway is still not set up  
* Connect w/o gateway at first, staged development? TBD  
* Jingchen: server + logger make sense on one machine  
* Read only auth on kafka  

Storage  
* Achiver time based stores all on machine, gpfs SAN, periodic flushing  
* Archiver does not require posix guarantees, Elasticsearch should probably work as well  
* NOTE: Make sure not using /tmp for storage
