# Timeline Review

Attendees: Greg White, Jackie Garrahan, Ernest Williams  
The purpose of this meeting is to review the preliminary timeline and hour estimate for the next generation alarm system project and to establish standards for progress reporting.

## Progress management
* Intend to use agile development with two-week sprint periods
* Going forward, include CSWG in meeting minute circulation
* Identify and track meeting decisions within minutes

## Timeline review
### Requirements deliverable
* ACTION ITEM: Give weights to requirements and divide into nice to have vs. need to have (w/ Matt Gibbs and William Colocho)
* ACTION ITEM: Remove GUI requirements in favor of configuration w/ json/xml and clear formatting guidelines

### Demo
* First demo, aim to satisfy as many requirements as possible
* RESOLUTION: Adding alarm filter on bypass variable will be sufficient for first demo
* Second demo with expanded functionality will be after designated development months

### Client/alerting development
* May not be allocating sufficient time
* Work may have to happen in parallel through different sprint periods despite not contributing to the deliverable for the sprint period

## Conclusion
* GOAL: System in production by the end of the fiscal year
* Difficult to plan past January. Forecasting will be more effective after phoebus alarm system architecture mapping and preliminary design review. 
* DECISION: Move forward with the current timeline with expectation to revise in December
* ACTION ITEM: Jackie will reformat and clean up the document into a proper table view
